        Nearing first decade into programming, loving it everyday <i className={"text-sm"}>(with ups and downs)</i>.
        <br/>Started building webpages with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and now that environment has expanded beyond my imagination.
        Now I use nodejs, graphql, vue, react, nuxt, next, strapi, tailwindcss, scss, bem, webpack, rollup, etc, etc.
        Yet again principles are the same: write performant, maintainable and scalable code, help your future self and others.
        &nbsp;Nowadays I&apos;m focused more on Javascript and Typescript with aim to write functional programing.
